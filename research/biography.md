"Ilya V. Talev

VOA Producer

Ilya Vasilev Talev, 70, a Bulgarian native who became a producer with the Voice of America's Bulgarian and Russian services, died of respiratory failure Jan. 12 at Suburban Hospital.

His family said he might also have had complications from a two-car accident near Buffalo on Jan. 9 while driving to Canada from his home in Rockville. His car hit a truck, and he and his wife were taken to the hospital but then released.

Starting in 1974, Dr. Talev worked about 25 years for the VOA. He was included in the 1991 delegation led by then-Vice President Dan Quayle to post-Communist Bulgaria.

Dr. Talev's book "Bulgarian Pre-Renaissance Myths and Reality," published in Bulgaria in 2005, said some of the country's best-known pieces of pre-Renaissance art, credited there as pioneering, were less advanced than, or copies of, works produced earlier in other nations.

Dr. Talev was a former newsletter editor for the American Association for the Promotion of Bulgarian Culture.

He also contributed opinion pieces to Bulgarian newspapers in which he criticized Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the young king deposed by the Communists after World War II who became the democratically elected prime minister in 2001.

Dr. Talev was a native of Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, and a graduate of Sofia University. He fled Bulgaria with the help of friends and forged documents.

He eventually settled in California and in 1972 earned a doctorate in Slavic languages from the University of California at Los Angeles. He lectured in Russian grammar, 17th-century literature and Slavic culture before moving to the Washington area in 1974.

Beginning in the 1980s, he created software for the Cyrillic alphabet on standard computer keyboards and developed a free series of Cyrillic fonts in block and cursive type for share over the Internet.

He collected Persian and other Eastern rugs.

Survivors include his wife of 39 years, Katherine Kircher Talev of Rockville; two daughters, Margaret Talev of Rockville and Elizabeth Talev of Austin, Tex.; and two granddaughters."
